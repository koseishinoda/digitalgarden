# Adding a Comment Function to the Digital Garden page

Option: Disqus

## Step1:  Create a Disqus account

You need to first create a Disqus account and configure it for your site. 
Follow the instruction at the official Disqus website. 

[Disqus tutorial](https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/#configuration-variables)

## Step2: Add comment.njk file to the digital garden repository

You need to then add a file called `comment.njk` in your GitHub repository. 
The file must be placed to a folder following the namespace rule. For instance, the `comment.njk` must be located at `src/site/_includes/components/user/note/footer 
See [Namespaces](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/) for the namespace rules.
