# What is Thermodynamics ?

Thermodynamics is often regarded as a universal science that rigorously describes the macroscopic behavior of systems. It provides a structured framework for understanding energy transformations and the relationships between various thermodynamic quantities. The scope of thermodynamics is broad, encompassing disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering, meteorology, and beyond.


##  Questions to address

- What are the different definitions of energy in thermodynamics ?
- How is free energy related to energy in other scientific domains?
- What is entropy ?
- What is temperature ?


## Different approaches

- Clausius approach
- Tasaki approach
