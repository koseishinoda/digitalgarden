# Definition

When the system can transition from a reference point of extensive variables $X^*$ to another state $X$ is achievable, for an arbitral temperature $T$, either the transition $\left(T;X\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)$ or the reverse transition $\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T;X\right)$ should be achievable via an [[2_Atoms/Adiabatic operation\|adiabatic operation]] $a$.

In this context, the internal energy $U$ is defined as follows: 
- If the transition $\left(T;X\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)$ is possible, then the internal energy $U$ is given by  
$$U(T;X)=W_{a}\left(\left(T;X\right)\rightarrow\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)\right),$$
where $W_a$ denotes the work performed by the surrounding on the system during the adiabatic operation $a$.
- If the reverse transition $\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T;X\right)$ is possible, then $U$ is defined as: 
$$U(T;X)=-W_{a}\left(\left(T^{*};X^{*}\right)\rightarrow\left(T;X\right)\right).$$
