# Definition

Consider a thermodynamic system in an equilibrium state denoted by $\left(T; X\right)$, where $T$ is the temperature and $X$ represents the set of extensive variables. We enclose this system within adiabatic walls and change the set of extensive variables from $X$ to $X'$ through mechanical operations applied from the surrounding. After the operation, the system reaches a new equilibrium state $\left(T'; X'\right)$. Note that the final temperature $T'$ is determined by the system itself. An operation that transforms an initial equilibrium state $\left(T; X\right)$ to a new equilibrium state $\left(T'; X'\right)$ in this way is called an **adiabatic operation**, and it is symbolically represented as:
$$\left(T;X\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T^{\prime};X^{\prime}\right)$$

# Existence of an Adiabatic Operation to Increase Temperature

Let $\left(T; X\right)$ denote an arbitrary equilibrium state of a thermodynamic system. For any temperature $T'$ such that $T' > T$, there exists an adiabatic operation that transforms the system from $\left(T; X\right)$ to $\left(T'; X\right)$, while maintaining the values of the extensive variables $X$.

During this operation, **positive work must be done on the system by the surrounding**.

Symbolically, this can be expressed as:

$$\left(T;X\right)\overset{a}{\rightarrow}\left(T^{\prime};X^{\prime}\right)\text{ where }~T^{\prime}>T~\text{ and }~X^\prime=X.$$

### Example: Adiabatic Stirring of a Viscous Fluid
Consider a viscous fluid contained in a thermally insulated (adiabatic) chamber. A mechanical stirrer is introduced into the system, and work is done on the fluid by stirring. The internal friction dissipates the mechanical energy as heat within the fluid. As a result, the system reaches a new equilibrium state with a higher temperature.
