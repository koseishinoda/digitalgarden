Justice. When we hear this word, it often evokes mixed reactions, or even outright rejection. Justice can  serve as a justification, as seen in the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. What one consider justice may starkly contrast with another's justice. But what about injustice? Injustice does not necessarily imply evil. Unlike justice, instead, injustice represents a space where common understanding might be achieved. 

Epistemic Injustice by Miranda Fricker was the 6th assigned book of our  philosophy club over the past 8 month. It is a challenging and intellectually dense book. It offered me a lot of valuable insights. While I cannot recall every detail, I will attempt to summarize the key takeaways. But proceeding, I must point out one thing. This book contains no illustrations to aid comprehension. Hence, I will endeavor to provide some visual representations, as I imagined while reading. 


# Testimonial Injustice

When you interview someone, on what basis you evaluate the credibility of what he/she say? Implicitly, you employ an internal scale, dynamically measuring credibility, perhaps ranging from 0 to 100. But what is this scale founded upon? The scale you rely on is crucial because all evaluations are relative to it. However, what you perceive as "neutral" is not universally fixed, like the zero potential of the Earth in an electrical circuit. Instead, this neutral is often shaped by personal biases, prejudices, and ideological assumptions. As a result, credible information may be unjustly dismissed due to these biases. Recognizing this injustice compels one to recalibrate the neutral point of their internal scale. This creates a closed-loop feedback system, continuously refining your scale to achieve greater fairness and objectivity.
