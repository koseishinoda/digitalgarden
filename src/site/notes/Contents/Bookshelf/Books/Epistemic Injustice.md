Justice. When we hear this word, it often evokes mixed reactions, or even outright rejection. Justice can  serve as a justification, as seen in the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. What one consider justice may starkly contrast with another's justice. But what about injustice? Injustice does not necessarily imply evil. Unlike justice, instead, injustice represents a space where common understanding might be achieved. 

Epistemic Injustice by Miranda Fricker was the 6th assigned book of our  philosophy club over the past 8 month. It is a challenging and intellectually dense book. It offered me a lot of valuable insights. While I cannot recall every detail, I will attempt to summarize the key takeaways. But proceeding, I must point out one thing. This book contains no illustrations to aid comprehension. Hence, I will endeavor to provide some visual representations, as I imagined while reading. 


# Testimonial Injustice

When you interview someone, on what basis you evaluate the credibility of what he/she say? Implicitly, you employ an internal scale, dynamically measuring credibility, perhaps ranging from 0 to 100. But what is this scale founded upon? The scale you rely on is crucial because all evaluations are relative to it. However, what you perceive as "neutral" is not universally fixed, like the zero potential of the Earth in an electrical circuit. Instead, this neutral is often shaped by personal biases, prejudices, and ideological assumptions. As a result, credible information may be unjustly dismissed due to these biases. Recognizing this injustice compels one to recalibrate the neutral point of their internal scale. This creates a closed-loop feedback system, continuously refining your scale to achieve greater fairness and objectivity.

# Hermeneutical Injustice

Consider a relationship between a supervisor and a female worker in a workplace before the concept of “sexual harassment” was recognized. Because the term “sexual harassment” did not exist, the supervisor was unaware that his actions were inappropriate, while the woman felt discomfort but lacked language to articulate her experience. Until the concept of sexual harassment was established and recognized, such behavior remained unrecognized and unaddressed. 

In the book, this is referred to as a lack of a resource. It can be compared to a world partially illuminated by streetlights: we can only perceive the lit areas, while the unlit parts remain obscured, leaving us unable to recognize what lies within them. The placement of these streetlights is often unjustly determined by societal structure and mass media, introducing a bias into which areas are illuminated and which remain in darkness. 

We must acknowledge the existence of these unlit areas $\textemdash$ experiences and concepts that lack recognition $\textemdash$  and strive to expand the illuminated zones. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive society that acknowledges and address marginalized experiences.
