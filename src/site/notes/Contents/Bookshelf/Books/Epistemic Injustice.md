Justice. When we hear this word, it often evokes mixed reactions, or even outright rejection. Justice can serve as a justification, as seen in the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. What one consider justice may starkly contrast with another's justice. But what about injustice? Injustice does not necessarily imply evil. Unlike justice, instead, injustice represents a space where common understanding might be achieved. 

Epistemic Injustice by Miranda Fricker was the 6th assigned book of our philosophy club over the past 8 month. It is a challenging and intellectually dense book. It offered me a lot of valuable insights. In this short essay, I will attempt to summarize the key takeaways. But before proceeding, I must point out one thing. This book contains no illustrations to aid comprehension. Hence, I will endeavor to provide some visual representations, as I imagined while reading. 

# Testimonial Injustice

Every individual wears metaphorical glasses through which they perceive the world. These glasses magnify topics of personal relevance, such as a professional’s focus on their specific field of expertise or an environmentalist’s focus on ecological conservation, while often blurring those outside their knowledge or focus. They may tint perceptions with biases, coloring opinions in ways that reinforce these perspectives, such as favoring progressive or conservative values, or aligning with specific religious or cultural ideologies. In extreme cases, these glasses create blind spots, rendering certain aspects of reality entirely unseen or misunderstood.

Individuals are not born wearing these glasses. Instead, they develop over time, molded and refined by life experiences, acquired knowledge, and interactions. These are profoundly influenced by the societal environment in which one is raised, reflecting its norms, values, and cultural context. The way people perceive the world is, hence, not innate; it is significantly shaped by subjective perceptions, prejudices, and prior judgments, all of which have been formed through life experiences.

In the context of communication, these metaphorical glasses have a profound influence on the exchange of information between a speaker and a hearer. They shape not only how the message is delivered but also whether it is received as credible. The hearer must evaluate what the speaker says, whether they may constitute valuable insight or are erroneous. In other words, the hearer must evaluate the speaker's credibility while listening. Evaluation always necessitates some measure of the speaker's credibility. A useful analogy for this evaluation process is the “scouter” from *Dragon Ball*, which assesses an individual’s power level. Similarly, one could imagine assigning a credibility score to a speaker, perhaps ranging from -100 to 100. But what is this scale founded upon?

The hearer relies on a metric to determine the speaker’s credibility. All evaluations are relative to that scale. However, there is no universal or completely objective scale for such evaluations. The glasses unconsciously alter what the hearer perceives as “neutral” or unbiased. Testimonial injustice can occur in such contexts, where a speaker’s word is discredited or devalued due to prejudice associated with their identity—such as race, gender, or socioeconomic background. As a result, credible information may be unjustly dismissed before being properly considered. This type of injustice not only silences the speaker but also deprives society of potentially valuable insights and experiences.

Addressing testimonial injustice requires first recognizing the existence of systematic biases that create credibility deficits for certain groups. Once these biases are acknowledged, it compels individuals to actively recalibrate the “neutral” point on their internal evaluation scales to neutralize the effects of prejudice. This recalibrations demands intentional effort and critical self-reflection—examining assumptions and actively seeking alternative perspectives. By continually polishing the glasses, individuals can cultivate greater fairness and objectivity, ultimately fostering, a more open-minded and inclusive discourse can be achieved.



# Hermeneutical Injustice

Consider a relationship between a supervisor and a female worker in a workplace before the concept of “sexual harassment” was recognized. Because the term “sexual harassment” did not exist, the supervisor was unaware that his actions were inappropriate, while the woman felt discomfort but lacked language to articulate her experience. Until the concept of sexual harassment was established and recognized, such behavior remained unrecognized and unaddressed. 

In the book, this is referred to as a lack of a resource. It can be compared to a world partially illuminated by streetlights: we can only perceive the lit areas, while the unlit parts remain obscured, leaving us unable to recognize what lies within them. The placement of these streetlights is often unjustly determined by societal structure and mass media, introducing a bias into which areas are illuminated and which remain in darkness. 

We must acknowledge the existence of these unlit areas—experiences and concepts that lack recognition—and strive to expand the illuminated zones. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive society that acknowledges and address marginalized experiences.
