# René Descartes


![Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_René_Descartes.jpg|300](/img/user/Contents/History/The%20Vis%20Viva%20Controversy/2%20Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes_DB/Frans_Hals_-_Portret_van_Ren%C3%A9_Descartes.jpg)

René Descartes (1596-1650) stands as one of the most influential figures in modern Western intellectual history. His principal works include:
	- **Meditations on First Philosophy** (1641) 
	- **Discourse on the Method** (1637) 
	- **Principles of Philosophy**, (1644) 
	- **Passions of the Soul** (1649).

He made significant contributions in a variety of fields:   
- **Cartesian Doubt and Rationalism**: Famous for the phrase _Cogito, ergo sum_ ("I think, therefore I am"), Descartes pioneered a method of systematic doubt, emphasizing reason as the path to certainty. His laid the groundwork for the Enlightenment. 
- **Analytic Geometry**: His revolutionary invention of the Cartesian coordinate system became the foundation for the calculus and modern mathematics.
- **Mind-Body Dualism**: (See [René Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction](https://iep.utm.edu/descartes-mind-body-distinction-dualism/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20deepest%20and,from%20that%20of%20the%20body%20))

# Descartes's law of nature

While Descartes is most renowned for his invention of coordinate system and rationalist philosophy, his work in physics also merits attention. In Principles of Philosophy (Hereinafter denoted as Pr) [@Descartes1985], Descartes articulated three fundamental *laws of nature* .

> **The first law of nature**: *each and every thing, in so far as it can, always continues in the same state; and thus what is once in motion always continues to move.* (PR.II.37)
> 
> **The second law of nature**: *all motion is in itself rectilinear; and hence any body moving in a circle always tends to move away from the centre of the circle which it describes.* (PR. II.39)
> 
> **The third law**: *if a body collides with another body that is stronger than itself, it loses none of its motion; but if it collides with a weaker body, it loses a quantity of motion equal to that which it imparts to the other body.*  (PR. II.40)


Newton's laws of motion, formulated later, bear some resemblance to Descartes's laws. Together the Descartes's first two laws provide an early explanation of the principle of inertia.

>*Each thing always remain in the same state and never changes expect as a result of external causes. If it is at rest, it will never mode unless it is pushed. And if it moves, it will ever lose the motion without being affected by external causes.* (PR.II.43)

However, they lack the mathematical rigor and precision that Newton introduced.

In the third law, Descartes articulates the concept of *quantity of motion* and its conservation. While this may appear overly simplistic and perhaps insufficient, he supported it with 7 rules for calculating the speed and direction of bodies after impact. However, as we know today, these rules are incorrect. The primary issue lies in his failure to distinguish between speed, a scalar quantity, and velocity, a vector quantity $\textemdash$a distinction later clarified by Huygens.  

Today, Descartes's name is seldom found in physics textbooks. While his work served as a foundational stepping stone for later developments in mechanics, it was incomplete, lacked sufficient rigor, or was ultimately proven incorrect. Considering the mathematical and experimental tools available at that time, it is unsurprising that certain limitations and misconceptions arose. However, this does not warrant the wholesale dismissal of his foundational ideas. For instance, while Einstein's relativistic theory rejected Newton's concept of absolute time, this should not lead to a complete rejection of his contributions. 

Scientific understanding is not static. It evolves with time. What we accept as fact today may one day be completely redefined or overturned. I believe that certain aspects of Descartes's framework warrant careful consideration rather than outright dismissal. In what follows, I will outlines Descartes's basic framework and highlight some key ideas that remain relevant for further discussions. 

# Descartes's basic framework

Central to Descartes's view of the universe if the idea that the essence of matter consists in extension $\textemdash$ its length, width, and depth, and it does not depend on anything else. No extension means no existence. It reflects the geometric properties in cartesian coordinates. 

A priori, Descartes considered that all space must be filled with matter and rejected vacuum. 

- Relative to the reference ?
- The only essence of matter (extension) shall always be divisible. There is no limit in divisibility in the essence of matter (extension). 
- What used to be believed as atoms (the smallest indivisible unit)  at that time doesn't exist. (PR.II.20)
- All the variety in matter depends on motion.  (PR.II.23)
- Lack of motion in a thing is at rest.
- Motion is a mode of matter.
- The quantity of motion is determined by the product of size and speed (PR.II.43)

- あらゆる運動の変化は物体同士の衝突 によって引き起こされるということである. その衝突の際には一方の物体から他方の物体へと motion が移される。
    
- The motion of any matter requires that the matter ahead of it be pushed forward. (PR.II.30)
- In all movements a complete circuit of bodies moves simultaneously. The principle resembles the modern notion of continuity for incompressible fluids. (PR.II.33)  

- (Pr.II.36) God is the primary cause of motion; and he always preserves the same quantity of motion in the universe
    
- God imparted various motions to the parts of matter when he first created the universe. I has a certain determinate quantity, and this remains constant in the universe as a whole while varying in any given part.   
    
- Thus if one part of matter moves twice as fast as another which is twice as large, we must consider that there is the same quantity of motion in each part; and if one part slows down, we must suppose that some other part of equal size speeds up by the same amount.
    
- Difference in translation
    
- From the third law, motion always persists in being as it is in itself and not in relation to other things, so long as it is not destroyed by an external cause by meeting another object.
-
- (Pr.II.45-52) provides seven rules to determine how individual bodies increase or diminish their motions or change direction as a result of collision with other bodies using ideal cases. The calculations in all seven rules presuppose that 'quantity of motion', measured as the product of size (extension) and speed, is preserved.
-  If x is twice the size of y, and is moving half as fast, then there's the same amount of motion in each.
- The notion of force thus enters through interchanges of motion dictated by a contest of forces: the force to resist change of motion and the force to produce it. The latter, Descartes asserted, depends on the size of the body and its speed, hence mv. 
- Universe = Extended matter in mortion
- the essence of matter is extension in length, breadth, and depth.
  

In Principles of Philosophy (Principia Philosophiae) from 1644, the French philosopher René Descartes defined "quantity of motion" (Latin: quantitas motus) as the product of size and speed,[64] and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.[64][65]

If x is twice the size of y, and is moving half as fast, then there's the same amount of motion in each.

[God] created matter, along with its motion ... merely by letting things run their course, he preserves the same amount of motion ... as he put there in the beginning.

This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of conservation of momentum, since Descartes had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size. (The concept of mass, as distinct from weight, was introduced by Newton in 1686.)[66] More important, he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes, if a moving object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed, there would be no change in its quantity of motion.[67][68][69] Galileo, in his Two New Sciences (published in 1638), used the Italian word impeto to similarly describe Descartes's quantity of motion.

To sum up, he offered a comprehensive vision of the universe as constituted from bare matter possessing the properties length, breadth, and depth (three-dimensional volume) and carved up into particles with size and shape, which may be in motion or at rest, and which interact through quantitative laws of motion
   

- In PR 11, Descartes argues that the essence of the matter is synonym to the space that occupies. He listed what are non-essential to the nature of a body. It is interesting that cold and heat are excluded. We will revisit this point in the discussion of heat.
